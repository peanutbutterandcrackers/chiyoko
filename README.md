# chiyoko
Python script to clone a directory hierarchy, that also processes it's multimedia files along the way 

So... Chiyoko was failing because of single quotes in the filenames, so, I was/am trying to figure out
a solution for it using regexes. But since I seem to have figured out a solution already, probably won't
be working on this for a while... or maybe I will...

Incomplete. Still needs quite a bit of work.
