Couldn't parse The folder - Dad's stuffs; obviously. Need to fix that.
$ sed y/\'/_/
$ for i in *\'*; do
	echo $( echo $i | sed y/\'/_/ );
  done
# use either sed or python regular expression to go through the dire-
  ctory first and rename all tom's_folder to tom_s_folder

it's imagemagick not imagemagick-common


--------------------

1) .wma files are being avconv-ed, for some reason. Not sure if that's a good thing...
2) .mp3 files (some) are also having the same issue as 1)
